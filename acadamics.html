            The concept of grouping students together in a centralized location for learning has existed since Classical antiquity. 
            Formal schools have existed at least since ancient Greece (see Academy), ancient Rome (see Education in Ancient Rome) ancient 
            India (see Gurukul), and ancient China (see History of education in China). The Byzantine Empire had an established schooling 
            system beginning at the primary level. According to Traditions and Encounters, the founding of the primary education system began 
            in 425 AD and "... military personnel usually had at least a primary education ...". The sometimes efficient and often large government 
            of the Empire meant that educated citizens were a must. Although Byzantium lost much of the grandeur of Roman culture and extravagance in 
            the process of surviving, the Empire emphasized efficiency in its war manuals. The Byzantine education system continued until the empire's 
            collapse in 1453 AD.

            n Western Europe, a considerable number of cathedral schools were founded during the Early Middle Ages in order to teach future clergy and administrators, 
            with the oldest still existing, and continuously operated, cathedral schools being The King's School, Canterbury (established 597 CE), King's School, Rochester
             (established 604 CE), St Peter's School, York (established 627 CE) and Thetford Grammar School (established 631 CE). Beginning in the 5th century CE, monastic 
             schools were also established throughout Western Europe, teaching religious and secular subjects.

                Islam was another culture that developed a school system in the modern sense of the word. Emphasis was put on knowledge, which required a systematic way of teaching and spreading
                knowledge and purpose-built structures. At first, mosques combined religious performance and learning activities. However, by the 9th century, the madrassa was introduced, a school 
                that was built independently from the mosque, such as al-Qarawiyyin, founded in 859 CE. They were also the first to make the Madrassa system a public domain under Caliph's control.
